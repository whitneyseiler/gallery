#Purpose
This service forms a part of the WeGot food review website. It renders 6 recommended restaurants based on proximity to the current restaurant selected showing basic information about a restaurant, including the name, description, type, neighborhood, price level, WeGot and Google reviews summary. Clicking on the restaurant will take you to the newly selected restaurant page.

#Database
A MongoDB database that holds restaurant information.

#Prerequisites
-npm -node -jest -webpack -MongoDB

#APIKey
To seed the database for the application, you will need a Google API key.

You can get an API Key from Google here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

Duplicate config.example.js and rename it to config.js. Replace the placeholder strings in your newly created config.js with your Google API key.

NOTE: You've now created the file referenced in seed.js as config.js that your app requires in order to seed the database.

#Installation
1. Install dependencies: `-npm install`
2. Start database server: `-npm run database`
3. Seed database: `-npm run seed-database`
4. Run React Webpack: `-npm run react-dev`,
5. Start server: `-npm server`

To start, in your browser navigate to: http://localhost:3001

#Tests
